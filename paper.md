# Summary

In neuroscience, characterizing the oscillatory dynamics of the brain is critical to understanding how brain areas interact and function. Neurons tend to fluctuate rhythmically â€“ both through intrinsic currents at the cellular level and as groups. Brain oscillations and their relationships can indicate the difference between normal and pathological brain states such as Alzheimer's and epilepsy. Spectral analysis techniques such as multitaper and wavelet analysis are widely used for decomposing signals into oscillatory components and connectivity measures are used to determine the relationships between those oscillatory components, indicating possible communication between brain areas. Because these analyses are central to neuroscience and technological advances in recording are increasing the amount of simultaneously recorded signals, it is important to have a well-tested, standardized, and lightweight software package to compute these brain connectivity measures at scale.


# Statement of Need

`spectral_connectivity` is a python software package that computes multitaper spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures. Python is a programming language increasingly being used in the neurosciences, but there are relatively few software packages written in python. For computing spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures, there are two main packages, `nitime` and `mne-python`, both of which are primarily written for data collected from humans using EEG, MEG, and fMRI. `spectral_connectivity`, in contrast, is written for non-human electrophysiology. This is important because the non-human neurosciences are also undergoing period of great technological development; more and more signals are being collected simultaneously and the duration of these signals is becoming longer as chronic recordings become possible. `spectral_connectivity` is designed to handle multiple time series and it can exploit GPUs for faster and more efficient computation. In addition, it can block compute important quantities such as the cross-spectral matrix in order to reduce memory burdens caused by large datasets. `spectral_connectivity` is also designed to be a lightweight package that has a simple user interface and can be easily be incorporated with other packages. Finally, `spectral_connectivity` also implements several connectivity measures that have not previously been implemented in python such as the non-parametric version of the spectral granger causality and canonical coherence.

`spectral_connectivity` has already shown its utility to the neuroscience field. The package has already been used in a number of publications and pre-prints in neuroscience ([@KuhnertDetectionDirectedConnectivities2019; @VargaNetworkPathConvergence2021; @LauroSubthalamicCorticalNetwork2021;
  , @Delgado-SallentPhencyclidineinducedpsychosiscauses2021]). Interestingly, it has also contributed to a publication in physics [@CliffUnifyingPairwiseInteractions2022], showing its versatility and easy of use.
